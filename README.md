# NumPY-for-absolute-dummies

This repository hosts an files and information pertaining to NumPy (or Numeric Python) - a library in Python that forms the fundamental building blocks of almost every Data Science and Machine Learning project today. The NumPy package is the workhorse of Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and scientific computing in Python ecosystem.
It vastly simplifies manipulating and crunching vectors and matrices. Some of the Python's leading packages rely on NumPy as a fundamental piece of their infrastructure (including but not limited to scikit-learn, pandas, sciPy, TensorFlow, et cetera).
